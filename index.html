I know I waited all my life to fall in love with you. Love is our true destiny. We do not find the meaning of life by ourselves alone - we find it with another.

I'm a simple girl who goes about my life as it comes. 

I don't understand much of what happens, 

but I go on hoping someday I'll understand.

I'm not gorgeous or beautiful, I'm just me, 

if you want to know my opinion. 

My imperfections are the only things I see,

when I take a good look in the mirror.

Maybe at an earlier part of my life

I may have believed those words applied to me, 

but not now not anymore

I'm a simple girl, I don't go around with high 

expectations in life, 

but I know what I deserve. 

The reason for this is

I've learned expecting things at such a high level 

won't ever meet what you want, 

but when you know what you deserve 

you can actually make sure you get it.

I'm a simple girl, I've learned the only person 

who will keep you in thought all day is God, 

I won't ever be the center of anyone else's mind.

I'm a simple girl, I've learned crying 

will always be a part of my life, 

and that's something I've learned to accept.

I'm a simple girl, 

I don't go pleasing everyone I know

because doing that 

won't ever cause me to be happy 

therefore I see no point.

I'm a simple girl, I don't think 

every guy will break my heart, 

but I know some will leave me hurting. 

I know the pain of heartache, 

and I also know the relief once it heals

even though in the deepest part of the heart 

there's a small piece 

that's either broken or stolen.

I am a simple girl, 

there's nothing really special about me. 

I wasn't blessed with a lot of things. 

Only a few things that I really need. 

I have a few real friends and a loving family.

I'm a simple girl, who has her imperfections, 

yes it's true. 

But the thing about these imperfections is 

I wouldn't change them for perfections 

because then I'd be a different person and not me.</p>

                <p>Only once in your life, I truly believe, you find someone who can completely turn your world around. You tell them things that you’ve never shared with another soul and they absorb everything you say and actually want to hear more. You share hopes for the future, dreams that will never come true, goals that were never achieved and the many disappointments life has thrown at you. When something wonderful happens, you can’t wait to tell them about it, knowing they will share in your excitement. They are not embarrassed to cry with you when you are hurting or laugh with you when you make a fool of yourself. Never do they hurt your feelings or make you feel like you are not good enough, but rather they build you up and show you the things about yourself that make you special and even beautiful. There is never any pressure, jealousy or competition but only a quiet calmness when they are around. You can be yourself and not worry about what they will think of you because they love you for who you are. The things that seem insignificant to most people such as a note, song or walk become invaluable treasures kept safe in your heart to cherish forever. Memories of your childhood come back and are so clear and vivid it’s like being young again. Colours seem brighter and more brilliant. Laughter seems part of daily life where before it was infrequent or didn’t exist at all. A phone call or two during the day helps to get you through a long day’s work and always brings a smile to your face. In their presence, there’s no need for continuous conversation, but you find you’re quite content in just having them nearby. Things that never interested you before become fascinating because you know they are important to this person who is so special to you. You think of this person on every occasion and in everything you do. Simple things bring them to mind like a pale blue sky, gentle wind or even a storm cloud on the horizon. You open your heart knowing that there’s a chance it may be broken one day and in opening your heart, you experience a love and joy that you never dreamed possible. You find that being vulnerable is the only way to allow your heart to feel true pleasure that’s so real it scares you. You find strength in knowing you have a true friend and possibly a soul mate who will remain loyal to the end. Life seems completely different, exciting and worthwhile. Your only hope and security is in knowing that they are a part of your life.</p>
